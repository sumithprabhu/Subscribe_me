# Subscribe Me

A subscription dApp that can be used by other dApps to integrate a model through which users can buy and cancel a subscription of their product and get notified with Push Notifications for every action.

This project uses Superfluid SDK 


## Features

- Buy subscription
- Cancel subscription
- Notified for every actions on dApp


## Problem it solves:

**Integration**: Managing subscriptions across different dApps can be complex and time-consuming for developers, who must build custom solutions for each platform. The subscription dApp would provide a standardized API that developers can easily integrate with to manage subscriptions in a consistent manner.

**Security**: This dApp would leverage blockchain technology to provide secure storage and management of subscription data, protecting user data from potential security breaches and unauthorized access.

**Notifications**: Keeping users informed about the status of their subscriptions is important to prevent billing issues or other subscription-related problems. This dApp would provide push notifications for subscription-related events, keeping users informed and up-to-date on the status of their subscriptions.
## Challenges faced:
As part of Challenges,

  - Used Superfluid SDK first time.
  - Struggled with react hooks.
  - Runtime error while deployment.
  -  Used Push SDK for frontend side and got some signer errors.
  Although all errors are solved now, and the project is up and running.
